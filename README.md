# LUIS Bot with Google Place integration.

A bot that integrated with Google Place API using LUIS intelligence. :)

We aim to build a smarter travel bot wiith this by maximizing Microsoft Cognitive services. Therefore we are rolling out these features. 


# Better Search 

a) better search - instead of asking multi-question and in multiple stages, user can just type in "travel from Auckland to Sydney from 12 June to 30 June. The bot will provide checklist options for user to select whether they would like to book "Flight, Car and Hotel together". From a single sentences, bots will drive interaction with buttons, making the process faster. 

# Schedule change

b) Change of schedule - We are able to support schedule changes when user utter word like "change booking". Bot will be able to pull out and try to rebook for user. 

The boot able to support the following media type (for extracting time / dates of travel) 

 bi) Image to Text
 
 bii) Text based -> example - copy and paste from mail sent by Airlines when they change flight schedule.
 
 
 # Self Learning
 
c) Users 'input' are tracked and used for machine training purposes using D-gram / Bag of words model using Python tensorflow RNN. 


 
# Application sample built so far.
